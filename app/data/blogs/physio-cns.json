If damaged on the left, pain and temperature loss occur on the right side of the body.  \n\n### **Anterior Spinothalamic Tract (Crude Touch & Pressure)**  \nPositioned more **anteriorly**, this tract carries **crude touch and pressure** sensations. Just like the lateral tract, it crosses over in the spinal cord, meaning left-side damage affects the right side.  \n\n---\n\n##  **Dorsal Column Tracts (Advanced Sensations) – Cross Late in the Medulla** \n\nThese tracts carry **fine touch, vibration, proprioception, and two-point discrimination**. Unlike the spinothalamic tracts, they **do not cross immediately**. Instead, they travel **on the same side (ipsilateral) within the spinal cord** and only cross over at the **medulla** before reaching the brain.  \n\n**📍 Left side damage in the spinal cord → Left side sensory loss**  \n\n### **Fasciculus Gracilis (Lower Body Sensations)**  \nLocated **medially** in the dorsal column, this tract carries **fine touch, vibration, and proprioception from the lower limbs**.  \n\n### **Fasciculus Cuneatus (Upper Body Sensations)**  \nSituated **laterally** in the dorsal column, this tract transmits **fine touch and proprioception from the upper body (arms, thorax)**.  \n\n---\n\n## **Key Difference: Early vs. Late Crossings**  \n- **Spinothalamic Tracts** cross **immediately in the spinal cord** (opposite-side loss).  \n- **Dorsal Column Tracts** stay **on the same side in the spinal cord** and cross **later in the medulla** (same-side loss if damaged in the spinal cord).  \n\n### Sensory Pathway to Cortex\n\n- Sensations travel from the spinal cord → thalamus → cortex.\n- Thalamus: Sensory relay center (except olfaction).\n- Ventro Posterolateral Nucleus (VPL): Receives all sensations except taste.\n- Ventro Posteromedial Nucleus (VPM): Receives taste.\n- Motor Nuclei: Ventrolateral, ventromedial, centromedian (motor functions).\n- overall path: 1st order neuron(receptor -> spinal cord), 2nd order (spinal -> thalamus) 3rd order (thalamus -> cortex) - > Sensory Pathway to Cortex\n\n",
